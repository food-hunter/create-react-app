## This is the code repository
After completing Free Code Camp and my responsive web design certification, I tried the React framework and some Javascript tutorials. This application was bootstrapped with the Create React app. I created multiple components and used some of the markup from my Free Code Camp courses to render React components. I later added React Router. This enables the URL to correspond with the element rendered on the page.
