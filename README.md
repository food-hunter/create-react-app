# The Sourdough Hut
## Welcome to the code repository for The Sourdough Hut!
After completing my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification and exploring React and JavaScript tutorials, I built this project to apply what I learned. This application was bootstrapped with Create React App and expanded to include multiple custom components and React Router.

### Project Highlights
React Components: I structured the application using reusable React components, integrating markup and styling concepts from my FreeCodeCamp courses.

### Dynamic Routing: 
React Router was added to handle dynamic navigation, allowing each URL to correspond with the appropriate component. This feature enhances the user experience by supporting seamless transitions between pages.

### Lessons:
While building this project, I encountered issues with CSS styles leaking into other components.
To fix this, I switched over to CSS Modules. By renaming my stylesheets to .module.css, I could scope styles directly to each component. Now, each component has its own set of styles that wonâ€™t interfere with any others, making it way easier to keep things organized and consistent.
